<p>Zinc is a moderately reactive metal that may react with dilute acids to produce hydrogen as well as interact with oxygen and other non-metals. Zinc is widely available in nature. The first mile of the earth&rsquo;s crust beneath the surface is thought to contain 224,000,000 million tonnes of zinc. However, these estimates do not take into account whether or not it is feasible economically or environmentally to use these resources. Sphalerite, sometimes referred to as zinc blende, is the most typical zinc mineral. This mineral, which is present in practically all commercially mined zinc resources, crystallizes as pure zinc sulfide from the hydrothermal solution. Among other metals, lead, copper, silver, and zinc are frequently mined together.</p>
